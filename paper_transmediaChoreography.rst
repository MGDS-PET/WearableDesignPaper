Abstract
--------------------------------------------------
Transmedia gaming refers to gaming that works between various electronic platforms and devices. 

In this research we describe interactions between a gaming system that exist simultaneously on-line, on TV, and within computer applications and wearable devices. Transmedia narratives are designed to migrate seamlessly between platforms and engage the viewers and players. 

To work between narratives on various platforms there is conceptual navigation through a narrative space. An application is described that requires bodily navigation through a physical space. A device that integrates these two aspects is discussed in this paper.


Introduction
--------------------------------------------------

This research is based on work on location-based treasure hunt iOS application called Time Tremors. This purpose of this application is to encourage engagement by children aged 7-11 with museum collections. Children use the application on a mart device within the museum and used to gamify to museum-going experience. Museum visiting becomes a hunt for specific artifacts within a theme, such as: beautiful beasts, journeys, weapons and war, ancestors and spirits. These hunts are carefully curated to pick details of artworks and sculptures, which could easily be missed on casual observation by children. The curators of these apps string together coherent and engaging narratives of these details.

Therefore the process of curation that lies behind the app (and which is important for the quality of its narratives and the engagement it inspires its users):

- assemble details of artworks and sculptures existing in the museum that can be organized together thematically (e.g. beautiful beasts, etc.)
- group these 'findings' in a coherent conceptual narrative
- also, group them such that visitors can physically navigate through the museum as they attempt to find the objects of the treasure hunt. 

There are two parts: There is a conceptual narrative that explains something about about the museum collection and about ideas that may be at various levels of abstraction. There is also a physical journey or path through the museum, which requires physical, bodily movement. So there are two types of choreography: conceptual and physical.

Existing Time Tremors game
..................................................

Player search for items, or 'treasures.' If they find these items they earn time energy. With sufficient time time energy than can unlock 'time treasures from the future.' Clues are provided to guide you to the treasure. In the game there is also an adversarial component: others are battling against to prevent you from unlocking these treasures.

There is a search > find > collect > search some more cycle in playing the game. 

Following directions through museum spaces 
.......................................................

Physical navigation involves following directions in the application. 

The artifacts in the museum are curated, in that there is framing of them that some fall into a specific theme. When players are directed by the application to try to find 'treasures.'  Clues for finding these treasures might include small detail photographs. Players have to scan the space of the museum to find small detailed parts of larger artifacts. This can be somewhat challenging and requires a level of concentration.

Sometimes contextual clues are provided to find the artifact. The objects surrounding an artifact in a showcase will provide a clue leading to the artifact. If the museum rearranges its showcases -- as they sometimes do -- then the application would require revision. 

Players are also given explicit instruction about where to go. These might say: 'go through the main entrance and by the stairs, turn left' A plan of the building is included in the application to orient the player. These directions are not so clear or unambiguous that the player will instantly find the treasure which she seeks. 

Focusing attention on a device screen
..................................................

In order to play the game in a museum the player must concentrate on the application as it guides you in its treasure quest. Players need to focus on the application when they play the game. This tends to take away their attention from the museum space and its collection. However, the application implicit intent is to increase ones engagement with the museum and its collection.

Therefore, it seems like it is working at cross-purposes: one one hand adding meta-data to details and descriptions of artifacts and structuring ones experience in a gamified way might add engagement to museum-going -- especially for young visitors. But focusing on a small screen while navigating through interesting interiors and artifacts seems a little counter-productive.

The mediation of museum-going
..................................................

This tends to mediate the experience of visiting the museum quite considerably. It takes the habit of constantly viewing your screen for the latest information to one realm where this is less common: visiting a museum. It would seem that focusing on the art that hangs on the walls, or the design of museum spaces to be a much better use of ones attention and focus. 

Importance of curation and content
..................................................

To make narratives that have sufficient quality to be worthwhile in museum settings, then the quality of this quality should be comparable to the curation of the museum itself. This is a difficult thing to achieve unless one has close cooperation with the museum curatorial staff.

Movement
..................................................

Walking around a museum is a type of choreography in that you need to navigate through museum spaces (some of which are quite dramatic and architecturally interesting). There is also gestures involved: people have to move their arms, hands and wrists in movements (that they may not engage in normally but which must be learned to play to game). These gestures are registered by the device. Big body movements that all able-bodied people are capable of performing and small body movements, which are not difficult to perform but require some learning and application to a specific game.

Small body movements involve:

- moving your arm, pivoting it around around your shoulder joint: this is more natural because you arm naturally makes such a movement 
- moving your arm in a abstract direction not necessarily related to your body or its joints, such as an x, y or z direction; these may feel unnatural

Where a movement is 'natural' or 'unnatural' is an important consideration. 


Treasures in the application vs. treasures in the real world
..................................................

Treasures in the application are domain objects. One collects treasures to acquire time energy to unlock more important treasures. Treasures can also be seen as objects that museums tend to collect: the reason they are in the museum is because they are treasures. 

Positives of the application in museum settings
..................................................

Museum going for the tween age group is a challenge. Their attention spans are limited. They have great curiosity but can easily miss telling details about artifacts, or their significance. Guided tours are helpful in this respect but may serve only a small minority of visitors in this age group. Applications that gamify the museum visiting experience for a demographic who are devoted to their screens seems like a promising strategy. 


Movements involved in the application
..................................................

On-screen movements:

- swiping with finger
- pinch-zooming
- tapping

In-air movements:

- moving fingers
- moving wrists
- moving arms


Why would people want to engage in small body movement?
........................................................

There are several possible motivations. One, is obviously to participate in the game. If the game is not entertaining then the player will not be motivated to learn the 'non-natural' movements. 

Why would a application user be motivated to learn application-specific movements? 
Some reasons are:

- the movements enable an engaging game to proceed
- the movements themselves are enjoyable
- the movements enable the player to express themselves in physical ways
- the movements connect movements
