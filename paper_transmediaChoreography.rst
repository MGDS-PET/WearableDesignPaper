Abstract
--------------------------------------------------
Transmedia gaming refers to gaming that works between various electronic platforms and devices. In tween this research we describe interactions between a gaming system that exist simultaneously on on-line, computer application, TV and wearable devices. Narratives can migrate seamlessly between these various platforms. This paper discussed aspects of this migration process as it relates to narratives and their structures.

Introduction
--------------------------------------------------

This research is based on work on location-based treasure hunt iOS app called Time Tremors. This purpose of this app is to encourage engagement by children aged 7-11 with museum collections. Children use the app on a mart device within the museum and used to gamify to museum-going experience. Museum visiting becomes a hunt for specific artifacts within a theme, such as: beautiful beasts, journeys, weapons and war, ancestors and spirits. These hunts are carefully curated to pick details of artworks and sculptures, which could easily be missed on casual observation by children. The curators of these apps string together coherent and engaging narratives of these details.

Therefore the process of curation that lies behind the app (and which is important for the quality of its narratives and the engagement it inspires its users):

- assemble details of artworks and sculptures existing in the museum that can be organized together thematically (e.g. beautiful beasts, etc.)
- group these 'findings' in a coherent conceptual narrative
- also, group them such that visitors can physically navigate through the museum as they attempt to find the objects of the treasure hunt. 

There are two parts: There is a conceptual narrative that explains something about about the museum collection and about ideas that may be at various levels of abstraction. There is also a physical journey or path through the museum, which requires physical, bodily movement. So there are two types of choreography: conceptual and physical.

Movement
..................................................

Walking around a museum is a type of choreography in that you need to navigate through museum spaces (some of which are quite dramatic and architecturally interesting). There is also gestures involved: people have to move their arms, hands and wrists in movements (that they may not engage in normally but which must be learned to play to game). These gestures are registered by the device. Big body movements that all able-bodied people are capable of performing and small body movements, which are not difficult to perform but require some learning and application to a specific game.

The small body movements involve 

- moving your arm in a direction, such as an x, y or z direction: this may feel unnatural because it may ignore the bio-mechanics of how your arms are connected to the rest of your body
- moving your arm, pivoting it around around your shoulder joint: this is more natural because you arm naturally makes such a movement. 

Why would people want to engage in small body movement?

THere are several possible motivations
