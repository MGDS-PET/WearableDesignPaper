	Annote = {Transmedia storytelling: a revolutionary technique for telling stories across multiple media platforms and {formats.It} is a must-have tool for pulling people into your {world.There's} never been a more exciting time to be a storyteller. Gatekeepers are falling.
Directly relevant to {'Time} Tremors' type productions.
Transmedia is more than mere marketing or franchise entertainment. It's the realm of stories at the edge of where reality ends and fiction begins.
For example, References and web {URLS} shown in fiction actually work. People will email you back.
This is not a game; that is, it is intended to matter more than a game.
West coast transmedia vs. East coast transmedia.
Origin of the term transmedia; from Dr Marsha Kinder.},
