Abstract
--------------------------------------------------

Wearable devices are useful for recording biometric data. When viewed over time, this data can be seen as a type of abstract, yet personal, narrative, whose origin is in how our body interacts with the world. This research connects the biometric data that such devices gather with interactive transmedia narratives (narratives that span between media channels).

Claims of research 
--------------------------------------------------

- people construct internal narratives to psychologically order their lives
- people's bodies create data, which can be seen as a kind of narrative
- people consume transmedia on multiple devices; this mode of media consumption is likely to increase as media convergence continues
- the narratives that people, that people's bodies display, and those that people consume on various devices are integrate-able
- wearable devices with biometric sensors are ideal first step towards this integration process

Introduction
--------------------------------------------------

Both narrative and transmedia are important, though sometimes quite hidden, aspects of modern lives. Narratives -- stories that people construct to explain their actions -- inform all aspects of interior and social life. Internal narratives seem important for our psychological makeup. 

People's physical bodies are also sources of personal narratives. The ebbs, flows, mental and physical capacities of people's bodies inform their lives.

Transmedia concerns how narratives of an external, usually manufactured sort, span multiple devices and multiple media channels. 

Transmedia is concerned deeply with narrative: a plot line may start on a computer, migrate to a TV and end up on a smart phone. These types of narratives are usually authored by writers with great intention, with explicit and carefully engineered connection points between media venues.

Certain points in any narrative that are more important than others. For instance, in a media property called Time Tremors (a series involving pre-teen children and their cosmically evil teacher) it is when ominous, supernatural things start happening to the protagonists, such as when toy bears start talking, bugs invade a classroom or when a so-called time tremor is triggered. These are special inflection points within the narrative that demand special attention. 

Narratives that are internally generated, ones which people have some agency in their creation, tend to be more significant in peoples lives compared to ones they receive externally and passively consume. 

In a similar fashion there are also inflection points in internal narratives; these are points in people's lives when life takes a different direction. 

Wearable device are useful by their ability to measure and identify these important 'inflection points.'


Internal narrative
--------------------------------------------------

Internal narratives are ones were construct within ourselves. People create narratives by reflecting on the processes within their lives. This process requires conceptual and cognitive engagement. 

Narratives are an important: people often order their lives in terms of narrative. They make sense of their lives through narratives. People are surrounded by narratives: external ones authored by others, which people consume for entertainment and social integration, and ones people construct or generate internally to make sense of their lives. Internal and external narratives interweave and intersect in people's thinking and behaviors. This is a primary way people create meaning in their lives. 


External transmedia
--------------------------------------------------

External narratives are written by writers to provide entertainment to viewers who wish to consume narratives on multiple devices and platforms. The transmedia idea is to encourage viewer engagement by minimizing the 'transaction costs' of switching devices. Tying together of multiple enriches the narrative, since it suggests narratives can sometimes change shape and venue yet still retain their overall direction and message, such as their narrative arc and characterization. The transmedia idea is an attempt to unify narrative and market it various venues, and to see its venue as a minor aspect that can be switched easily and casually. 



If bodies are the sources of important narratives then to measure aspects of people's bodies, their mobility, their biometrics, their positioning in space and time, could become a source of useful narratives, which people might miss in ordinary reflection and memory. To enrich people's memory, sense of self and reflective capacity using bodily data is the aim of this research.

For instance, wearable devices that monitor sleep patterns support people who may have difficult remembering their sleep patterns. These patterns are an important aspect of their overall health and wellness. In addition, sleep data influences self-reflection and sense of self. This cognitive aspect goes beyond physical health to include general mental health. 

An evidence, or sensor-based approach is since people's awareness of their own sleep patterns is limited since people are not awake when sleep occurs. Monitoring of basic bodily processes is a major market for wearable technology. 

Bodily data -> narrative construction

Monitoring is one simple type of narrative construction using bodily processes. We propose that this process can be generalized for other bodily processes, such as heart rate, blood pressure and skin conductivity. we attempt to accurately measure these aspects of the body and from that data to construct meaningful narratives from them.

This paper discusses ways of doing this. 

Our ambitions are to include narratives in its broader meaning to the functionality of wearables. 


One way of creating internal narratives is to measure peoples bodies.  

Transmedia concerns narratives that span multiple media and devices.  


There are certain points in any narrative that are more important than others. For instance, in the Time Tremors world it might be when supernatural things start happening, such as when toy bears start talking, bugs invade your space or you experience a Time Tremor. Some kind of vibrotactile feedback could be applied to the user to correspond to these narrative turning events. 


Ideas
--------------------------------------------------

Narratives are 

Unified navigation => There exists one type of navigation (= traversing a graph structure) that enable players to explore:
	- a collection of artifacts (for collection games), 
	- a series of spaces or places (for geo-locative games)
	- narratives points in stories

Unified naviagation =
	- one type of information structure (=graph)
	- various content embedded in this graph (artifcats, narratives, )

Things you can't omit from TT:
	- collections of artifacts distributed in space/plan
	- narratives = series of artifacts joined together 


non-trivial wearable requirements:
	- self sufficient
	- thing of beauty on your body
	- inspires joyful movement
	- inspires authoring creativity
	- inspires depths of emotion

micro-choreography (gestures for expressive movement):
	- people want to express themselves through movement
	- designers of these movements (choreographers) want to design movements that are aesthetically pleasing and mean something
	- designing gestures for application purposes is a 
	- movements with aesthetic concerns are more desirable than arbitrary movements

transmedia:
	- canned transmedia content depends on the quality of transmedia
	- usually this transmedia content is designed for commercial purposes
	- people want to contribute their own movements into a suite of movements
	- movement desigend for commercially inspired  are likely to be 

quality of movement:
	- using gestures for controlling applications depends on the quality of the application 
	- they feel constrained and inhibited to use their major limbs
	- using minor limbs, they could less inhibited

time-tremors:
	- 

- gestures are quite boring when used to manipulative things on wearable devices
- gestures should be:
	- non-arbitrary
	- easy to learn
	- expressive of something that relates to a narrative
	
	- have some connection to something meaningful
	- able to choreographed into 


Interesting questions?
--------------------------------------------------

- if you want 
- what does the TT game involve?
	- gesture recognition
	- transmedia narrative

- why?
